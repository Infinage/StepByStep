    "## Question:\n",
    "\n",
    "Given a plaintext and a key k, write a python script to convert it into cipher text using **Vignere cipher**. Also write functions for decrypting it.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### A bit of Background:\n",
    "Vignere Cipher is a *polyalphabetic substitution* cipher. Vignere cipher is very similar to *Caesar Cipher* except that the shift for each alphabet of the plain text varies based on it's relative position in the plain text and the corresponding shift value in key. \n",
    "\n",
    "Simply put, instead of having a single shift value, a vignere cipher key has an array of shift values that determine the shift to be made for each alphabet. We understand this better using a simple example:\n",
    "\n",
    "Say we are given a key `k = BOMB` (*We have an array of keys as opposed having a single key*) <br>\n",
    "We are also given a `text = Bomb Tonight Or We'd Get Bombed!`<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "<u>For Encryption:</u>\n",
    "\n",
    "Each alphabet in the key denotes a shift value. For example, character \"B\" in the key implies \"A -> B\" meaning a shift value of 1. Similarly character \"O\" in the key implies \"A -> O\" meaning a shift value of 14, etc. Encryption is accomplished by placing the Keys corresponding to the position of characters in plain text. These keys are used in cyclical fashion one after another. \n",
    "\n",
    "Strictly speaking, white spaces & special characters in the plain text need to be removed before encryption. But for the sake of simplicity let's ignore these characters instead of removing them. \n",
    "\n",
    "For the above example, this would look something like this:\n",
